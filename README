WHAT IS THIS ?

This is Filesys::SmbClientParser, a module which provide routine 
to reach Samba ressources

SmbClientParser work with output of bin smbclient, so it doesn't work
on win platform. (but query of win platform work of course)

A best method is work with a samba shared librarie and xs language, 
but on Nov.2000 (Samba version prior to 2.0.8) there is no public 
interface and shared library defined in Samba projet.

Request has been submit and accepted on Samba-technical mailing list, 
so a new module with name SmbClient will be done as soon as the public 
interface has been known.

For Samba client prior to 2.0.8, use this module !

SmbClientParser is adapted from SMB.pm make by Remco van Mook 
mook@cs.utwente.nl on smb2www project.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT ?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you can't do that, you can put SmbClientParser.pm file in
directory $root/Filesys/SmbClientParser.pm and then put use lib 
$root in your program

REQUIREMENT ? 

Executable smbclient

DOCUMENTATION ?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file
HTML.pm in POD format

When you install Filesys::SmbClientParser, the 
MakeMaker program will automatically install the 
manual pages for you (on Unix systems, type 
"man Filesys::SmbClientParser").

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
